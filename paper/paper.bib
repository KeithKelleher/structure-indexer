	Abstract = {Consideration is given to a document data base that is structured for information retrieval purposes by means of an inverted index and term dictionary. Vocabulary characteristics of various fields are described, and it is shown how the data base may be stored in a compressed form by use of restricted variable length codes that produce a compression not greatly in excess of the optimum that could be achieved through use of Huffman codes. The coding is word oriented. An alternative scheme of word fragment coding is described. It has the advantage that it allows the use of a small dictionary, but is less efficient with respect to compression of the data base.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Registration, indexing and searching of chemical structures in relational databases is one of the core areas of cheminformatics. However, little detail has been published on the inner workings of search engines and their development has been mostly closed-source. We decided to develop an open source chemistry extension for Oracle, the de facto database platform in the commercial world.
RESULTS: Here we present OrChem, an extension for the Oracle 11G database that adds registration and indexing of chemical structures to support fast substructure and similarity searching. The cheminformatics functionality is provided by the Chemistry Development Kit. OrChem provides similarity searching with response times in the order of seconds for databases with millions of compounds, depending on a given similarity cut-off. For substructure searching, it can make use of multiple processor cores on today's powerful database servers to provide fast response times in equally large data sets.
AVAILABILITY: OrChem is free software and can be redistributed and/or modified under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation. All software is available via http://orchem.sourceforge.net.},

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: Identifying the location of binding sites on proteins is of fundamental importance for a wide range of applications, including molecular docking, de novo drug design, structure identification and comparison of functional sites. Here we present Erebus, a web server that searches the entire Protein Data Bank for a given substructure defined by a set of atoms of interest, such as the binding scaffolds for small molecules. The identified substructure contains atoms having the same names, belonging to same amino acids and separated by the same distances (within a given tolerance) as the atoms of the query structure. The accuracy of a match is measured by the root-mean-square deviation or by the normal weight with a given variance. Tests show that our approach can reliably locate rigid binding scaffolds of drugs and metal ions.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: We provide this service through a web server at http://erebus.dokhlab.org.},

	Abstract = {The compressed feature matrix (CFM) is a feature based molecular descriptor for the fast processing of pharmacochemical applications such as adaptive similarity search, pharmacophore development and substructure search. Depending on the particular purpose, the descriptor may be generated upon either topological or Euclidean molecular data. To assure a variable utilizability, the assignment of the structural patterns to feature types is arbitrarily determined by the user. This step is based on a graph algorithm for substructure search, which resembles the common substructure descriptors. While these merely allow a screening for the predefined patterns, the CFM permits a real substructure/subgraph search, presuming that all desired elements of the query substructure are described by the selected feature set. In this work, the CFM based substructure search is evaluated with regard to both the different outputs resulting from varying feature sets and the search speed. As a benchmark we use the programmable atom typer (PATTY) graph algorithm. When comparing the two methods, the CFM based matrix algorithm is up to several hundred times faster than PATTY and when using the CFM as a basis for substructure screening, the search speed is accelerated by three orders of magnitude. Thus, the CFM based substructure search complies with the requirements for interactive usage, even for the evaluation of several hundred thousand compounds. The concept of the CFM is implemented in the software COFEA. FIGURE CFM based substructure search using the compounds dopamine and benzene-1,2-diol},

@article{Kumar:2014df,
	Abstract = {The challenge of automatically identifying the preserved molecular moieties in a chemical reaction is referred to as the atom mapping problem. Reaction atom maps provide the ability to locate the fate of individual atoms across an entire metabolic network. Atom maps are used to track atoms in isotope labeling experiments for metabolic flux elucidation, trace novel biosynthetic routes to a target compound, and contrast entire pathways for structural homology. However, rapid computation of the reaction atom mappings remains elusive despite significant research. We present a novel substructure search algorithm, canonical labeling for clique approximation (CLCA), with polynomial run-time complexity to quickly generate atom maps for all the reactions present in MetRxn. CLCA uses number theory (i.e., prime factorization) to generate canonical labels or unique IDs and identify a bijection between the vertices (atoms) of two distinct molecular graphs. CLCA utilizes molecular graphs generated by combining atomistic information on reactions and metabolites from 112 metabolic models and 8 metabolic databases. CLCA offers improvements in run time, accuracy, and memory utilization over existing heuristic and combinatorial maximum common substructure (MCS) search algorithms. We provide detailed examples on the various advantages as well as failure modes of CLCA over existing algorithms.},

	Abstract = {We present a novel technique for a fast chemical substructure search on a relational database by use of a standard SQL query. The symmetry of a query graph is analyzed to give additional constraints. Our method is based on breadth-first search (BFS) algorithms implementation using Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS). In addition to the chemical search we apply our technique to the field of intermolecular interactions which involves nonplanar graphs and describe how to achieve linear time performance along with the suggestion on how to sufficiently reduce the linear coefficient. From the algorithms theory perspective these results mean that subgraph isomorphism is a polynomial time problem, hence equal problems have the same complexity. The application to subgraph isomorphism in chemical search is available at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-srv/chemsearch and http://www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-srv/msdmotif/chem .

	Abstract = {With the growth of interest in database searching and compound selection, the quantification of chemical similarity has become an area of intense practical and theoretical interest. One of the most widely used methods of measuring chemical similarity is based on mapping fragments within a molecule as bits within a binary string. We present empirical results which suggest that bit strings provide a nonintuitive encoding of molecular size, shape, and global similarity. Other results, this time statistical in nature, suggest that the observed behavior of bit string-based searches have a large nonspecific component. On this basis, we question whether bit string-based similarity methods possess all the features desirable in a quantitative chemical distance measure or metric and suggest that there are instances when they may not be the most appropriate tool for searching or segregating chemical structures.},

	Abstract = {Efficient substructure searching is a key requirement for any chemical information management system. In this paper, we describe the substructure search capabilities of ABCD, an integrated drug discovery informatics platform developed at Johnson \& Johnson Pharmaceutical Research \& Development, L.L.C. The solution consists of several algorithmic components: 1) a pattern mapping algorithm for solving the subgraph isomorphism problem, 2) an indexing scheme that enables very fast substructure searches on large structure files, 3) the incorporation of that indexing scheme into an Oracle cartridge to enable querying large relational databases through SQL, and 4) a cost estimation scheme that allows the Oracle cost-based optimizer to generate a good execution plan when a substructure search is combined with additional constraints in a single SQL query. The algorithm was tested on a public database comprising nearly 1 million molecules using 4,629 substructure queries, the vast majority of which were submitted by discovery scientists over the last 2.5 years of user acceptance testing of ABCD. 80.7\% of these queries were completed in less than a second and 96.8\% in less than ten seconds on a single CPU, while on eight processing cores these numbers increased to 93.2\% and 99.7\%, respectively. The slower queries involved extremely generic patterns that returned the entire database as screening hits and required extensive atom-by-atom verification.},

@article{Liu:2011wd,
	Abstract = {The utility of chemoinformatics systems depends on the accurate computer representation and efficient manipulation of chemical compounds. In such systems, a small molecule is often digitized as a large fingerprint vector, where each element indicates the presence/absence or the number of occurrences of a particular structural feature. Since in theory the number of unique features can be exceedingly large, these fingerprint vectors are usually folded into much shorter ones using hashing and modulo operations, allowing fast "in-memory" manipulation and comparison of molecules. There is increasing evidence that lossless fingerprints can substantially improve retrieval performance in chemical database searching (substructure or similarity), which have led to the development of several lossless fingerprint compression algorithms. However, any gains in storage and retrieval afforded by compression need to be weighed against the extra computational burden required for decompression before these fingerprints can be compared. Here we demonstrate that graphics processing units (GPU) can greatly alleviate this problem, enabling the practical application of lossless fingerprints on large databases. More specifically, we show that, with the help of a ~$500 ordinary video card, the entire PubChem database of ~32 million compounds can be searched in ~0.2-2 s on average, which is 2 orders of magnitude faster than a conventional CPU. If multiple query patterns are processed in batch, the speedup is even more dramatic (less than 0.02-0.2 s/query for 1000 queries). In the present study, we use the Elias gamma compression algorithm, which results in a compression ratio as high as 0.097.},

	Abstract = {The calculation of pairwise compound similarities based on fingerprints is one of the fundamental tasks in chemoinformatics. Methods for efficient calculation of compound similarities are of the utmost importance for various applications like similarity searching or library clustering. With the increasing size of public compound databases, exact clustering of these databases is desirable, but often computationally prohibitively expensive. We present an optimized inverted index algorithm for the calculation of all pairwise similarities on 2D fingerprints of a given data set. In contrast to other algorithms, it neither requires GPU computing nor yields a stochastic approximation of the clustering. The algorithm has been designed to work well with multicore architectures and shows excellent parallel speedup. As an application example of this algorithm, we implemented a deterministic clustering application, which has been designed to decompose virtual libraries comprising tens of millions of compounds in a short time on current hardware. Our results show that our implementation achieves more than 400 million Tanimoto similarity calculations per second on a common desktop CPU. Deterministic clustering of the available chemical space thus can be done on modern multicore machines within a few days.},

	Abstract = {In ligand-based screening, retrosynthesis, and other chemoinformatics applications, one often seeks to search large databases of molecules in order to retrieve molecules that are similar to a given query. With the expanding size of molecular databases, the efficiency and scalability of data structures and algorithms for chemical searches are becoming increasingly important. Remarkably, both the chemoinformatics and information retrieval communities have converged on similar solutions whereby molecules or documents are represented by binary vectors, or fingerprints, indexing their substructures such as labeled paths for molecules and n-grams for text, with the same Jaccard-Tanimoto similarity measure. As a result, similarity search methods from one field can be adapted to the other. Here we adapt recent, state-of-the-art, inverted index methods from information retrieval to speed up similarity searches in chemoinformatics. Our results show a several-fold speed-up improvement over previous methods for both threshold searches and top-K searches. We also provide a mathematical analysis that allows one to predict the level of pruning achieved by the inverted index approach and validate the quality of these predictions through simulation experiments.
